 volpak C++ rewrite

Should have been re-written in R, but then how would I get practice with C++?

Focus on learning about inheritance, runtime polymorphism, smart pointers, runtime type information, and object creation patterns (Abstract Factory).

Volpak code originally written in Fortran by Vanclay (Unknown year), translated to C by Peter Gordon (Unknown year), and maintained by Eric Keady (2000 - 2006). Work done for various incarnations of QLD Government Plantation Forestry Department (DPI, FPQ, etc.)

Some bugs in C implementation were identified during the re-write. These were corrected with the minimal amount of modification of the original C code, i.e. used work-arounds where possible.
